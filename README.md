# 32-Bit-Pipelined-Processor
This project involves a microprocessor receiving data from a  32-bit data bus whcih will be processed in a multi-stage pipeline
for instruction execution. The instruction processing is broken down into stages like fetch, decode, execute, memory access, 
and write back, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously with the help of forwarding and hazard detection,
enhancing overall performance. The pipeline helps achieve higher throughput by overlapping the execution of different instructions
in consecutive stages.
